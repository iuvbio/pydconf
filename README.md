pytermconf
===

Python wrapper around `dconf` to create and modify gnome-terminal profiles.

> dconf is a low-level configuration system and settings management tool. Its main purpose is to provide a back end to GSettings on platforms that don't already have configuration storage systems. It depends on GLib. It is part of GNOME 3 and is a replacement for GConf.
